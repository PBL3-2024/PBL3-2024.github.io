### Document Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

Requirements in this specification are classified at three levels of aggregation to suit the needs of various readers of this document: functional or non-functional, user requirement identifier, and an optional trailing system requirement subidentifier. Unless otherwise stated, it is to be assumed that each requirement is hierarchical and that stated user-level requirements implicitly depend on the system requirements sharing the same identifier.

Functional requirements will be prefixed with "FREQ-". Non-functional requirements will be prefixed with "NREQ-".

Requirement identifiers will be proceeded by a short title. This title should be applicable to the requirement, but should not be construed as part of the requirement and exists only to improve the navigability and searchability of this document.

FREQ-0 Example User Requirement
: This denotes a functional user requirement with the id of 0

NREQ-0.0 Example System Requirement
: This denotes a non-functional system requirement with the id of 0.0. This requirement is implicitly a dependency of the non-functional user requirement NREQ-0.
