# April 9th Meeting Minutes

Atendees: Everyone

Meeting Objective: Start brainstorming possible project ideas

- English Yahoo Maps/meeting
    - No connection between train schedules and meetups -> not complex enough
    - Hazard Maps/Handicap Oriented Maps
        - Discussed it as a good idea but did not refer to the professors
 - Custom Running App
   - Good idea but already implemented many times before
    - Could add crossing signal data or optimize running path and pace but issue of where to find that data
     - In the end decided that it was not complex enough to add new ideas on top of what was already done
- Ride share
  - Good idea but question of if it is viable or complex enough. Not enough data points -> where to get the data points from.
 
- Decided for the next meeting to be on April 10th
    - Goals to acheive by then:
        - Brainstorm more ideas by reading the given text
        - Set up website and get started on intial edits (Andi & Satvik)
