#Project Proposal #2: Career Planning System

Vision:
- Our vision is to develop a smart job suggestion system that utilizes data from Manaba, our university's course management platform, to provide personalized career guidance and recommendations to students. By utilizing course enrollment data, the system aims to assist students in making informed decisions about their academic and career paths, shaping their future paths in sectors such as social entreprenuership and corporate jobs
 
Problem Statement:
- Transitioning from university education to the workforce can be a struggle for students, who often lack clarity on which courses and skills are most relevant to their desired career paths. Students may also struggle to identify the connections between their academic coursework and potential job opportunities. On the other hand, social workers and corporate companies tend to have their own system for recruting employees but struggle to find their techinical abilties that is required to do certain jobs. Our career planning system aims to address these challenges by leveraging data from Manaba to offer recommendations on courses, skills, and career pathways that align with each student's interests, strengths, and aspirations. Furthermore, people or companies already in the workforce would also benefit from this system by being able to understand intricate details regarding future employees. 

Objectives:
- To Develop an intuitive user interface for the job suggestion system, ensuring ease of navigation and interaction for students.
- To Integrate data from Manaba, including course enrollment records, curriculum details, and academic performance to generate personalized job recommendations.
- To Utilize machine learning algorithms and data analytics techniques to identify patterns and correlations between course selections and career outcomes. To Offer actionable insights and suggestions to students regarding which courses to take, skills to develop, and career paths to pursue based on their individual profiles and goals.
- Provide supplementary resources and information to support students in their career exploration and decision-making process.


Scope of the Project:
- The scope of the project encompasses the following tasks:
- Accessing and extracting relevant data from the Manaba platform, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical standards.
- Designing and implementing algorithms to analyze course enrollment patterns and identify correlations with job placements and career trajectories. Developing the backend infrastructure to process and analyze data, as well as the frontend interface for student interaction.
- Incorporating user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the accuracy and relevance of job suggestions.
- Conducting rigorous testing and validation to assess the effectiveness and usability of the job suggestion system.


Overview of the Chosen Problem Area within Smart Cities:
- In the context of smart cities, our job suggestion system contributes to the development of a knowledgeable and skilled workforce that aligns with the evolving needs of industries and employers. By leveraging data from Manaba to provide targeted career guidance, the system supports the cultivation of talent, boosting economic growth and innovation.
