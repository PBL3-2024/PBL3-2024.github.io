## University Course and Career Identity Matcher

### Keywords

- Business Friendliness
- Social Entrepreneurship
- Higher Education
- Human Capital

### Abstract

Since 2015, only half of the students that graduated from IT programs in Australia are working in IT-adjacent fields. This implies that there are a large number of trained technologists that are being underutilized in their current careers. In this project, we propose a system that matches students with social and capital entrepreneurs based on specific courses taken and job requirements.

### Impact

This project aims to allow a city to make more efficient use of its human capital. People that have worked to obtain skills but are not sure how to utilize them can receive guidance towards a more fulfilling career, either in solving social problems or more traditional corporate ventures. Entrepreneurs that are looking to solve a societal problem can leverage our repository of students to find human capital.

## Driving Tourists to Small Businesses

### Keywords

- Business Friendliness
- Cultures, Tourism, Recreation

### Abstract

Advanced business and socio-cultural attractiveness is a key element of smart cities (Kourtit et al.). Tourism is an important aspect in local economies, and as such efficiently connecting tourists to businesses is an essential role of a smart city. In this project, we propose a system that assists users in planning a vacation while suggesting local businesses as detours to fill gaps in their schedules.

### Impact

This project aims to allow a city to offer a welcoming environment to new businesses. By offering visibility to low-traffic businesses, this project hopes to encourage additional business growth in the city and its associated economic benefits to its citizens.
