1.     How to categorize/classify types of human capital? Is this right way, do we need a different kind of classification? (We are planning to use SOC codes: US classification system for types of jobs and we have data of demand of specific jobs over time)
 
2.     How can we use historical data to predict demand? Can we use linear regression is that sufficient? (Idea we already have: Polynomial exponential, ARIMAmodel)
 
3.     Might not be accurate, should we allow smart city managers to overwrite predictions? (For example, manually input needed human capital)
 
4.     How can we visualize the data? (both prediction and manual data) Would a simple line graph work? (other examples: area range, column range, pie chart)
 
5.     What are possible metrics to use to understand if systems are correct? (We are thinking that KPIs is useful) (We are thinking to check How many people try to transfer their job to suggested job and how many people have success to transfer job)
 
6.     How to present where the system wants users to be in a user-friendly way? (ex.Can we able to outright tell them to move job?)
 
7.     What can the system provide to the user to get to their goal owe its identified? (We already have a dataset that connect SOC codes to certifications, and we can add additional learning resources)
 
8.     How can we organize learning resources for users? (ex. videos/lessons->certification tests)
 
9.     Do you have other idea of feachers that we should add to our project?
