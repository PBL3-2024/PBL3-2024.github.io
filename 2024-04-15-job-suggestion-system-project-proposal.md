# Job Suggestion System project Proposal

1. The Problem
* Students who are confused regarding what they want in the future can find it hard to choose the right classes to take for the proffesion they aspire for. On the opposite side, students in some senarios take classes not knowing their heading direction for job hunting.
  * **Some employers sometimes do not know the knowledge of prospective employers which can cause some trouble during the hiring process
 
2. The Solution
* With the job suggestion system, it allows for students to clear up any uncertainty they might have had regarding what career path their selected paths could take them on. The system would also also students to get a clear idea of what classes they can also take depending of their desired career path.

3. Project Objectives
* Implement a dataset that involves Job postings on an online website (decide what dataset from where specifically. Possibly takes the user directly to the webiste with the job posting)
  * (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vq2cfzncxf7dg : Too expensive but can find alternatives) 
* Implement a dataset that includes the listed classes that can be taken in the ISSE department
  * (Ask Ritsumeikan for the dataset) 
* Combine the two datasets and allow ChatGPT to be the main source of communication between the two datasets and the user
  * (Can use for a cheap subscription)
 
4. Derivables
* External
  * A web page consisting of ChatGPT that can converse with a user regarding Ritsumeikan ISSE courses and relevant job postings
* Internal
  * Documentation regarding each step of the process including meetings that ensures the smooth progression of the product
  * A website that involves all the documentation and the system architecture
  * Two presentations that provides the progress made and the final overview of the entire product prototype
