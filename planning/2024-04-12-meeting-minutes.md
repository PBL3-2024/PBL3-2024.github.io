Meeting Objectives: Discuss both project ideas and get a solid understanding of both


- Ask professors for the possibility of officially asking the Public Transportation Data Center for the license for train schedules 
- Or ask Japanese teammates to write an official request 
- Suggestion based on previous searches might be too complicated, put that away for now (depending on if we can find google search API)
- Draft project proposal
    - Problem identification
    - Data acquisition
    - Both ideas seem to be great so work on both for now and work ahead of schedule
    - Find APIâ€™s and data sets
    - Refine the reasonings
- Brush up the website (create tabs)
