# PBL3 Project Proposal
## Bottom-up Agile Engagement of Human Capital in Smart Cities

### Overview 
In today’s rapidly changing world, traditional bureaucratic governance processes are often inadequate for handling human capital in modern societies. Smart cities, however, have the potential to revolutionize this dynamic by eschewing top-down command structures and instead utilizing agile governance principles to engage their citizenry directly in human resource management. This document proposes a system that will encourage collaboration between smart city managers and their populace to explore and enhance competencies available in the city’s workforce. The system aims to utilize users’ occupational information along with current job openings to guide users toward the best career path for them as individuals and the city as a whole. By combining labor statistics and input from smart city managers, this system would also predict future demand for city projects and encourage citizens to upskill or reskill to aid in them.

### Problem statement - Background
Today, as technological advancements integrated into society continue to have transformative improvements, it calls for human capital to adapt to this rapid change. To unlock the potential of these technologies, it requires changes at the micro-level (introducing changes into business processes) and macro-level (increasing available human capital), which does take time (A. Arendt, 2015). Though these methods do contribute to positive outcomes of advancements, they focus on the top-down approach, giving most of the decision power to companies and cities themselves on how goals are to be achieved. To combat this, by allowing employees to steer their career paths, agile practitioners can introduce more flexible and agile governance techniques that allow employees to “respond to public changes in an efficient way” (I. Mergel, 2020). Smart city managers strive to embody these techniques, but their lack of sufficient human resources often becomes a barrier to implement their vision (Guenduez et al, 2024). The team proposes a system that uses agile principles to help smart city managers and their citizens identify gaps in the population’s capabilities and quickly reskill or upskill to fill them to benefit the advancements of city goals. 

### Vision - Goals
This system aims to empower cities to leverage agile principles in their utilization of human capital to foster a thriving dynamic workforce ecosystem. Where, in this ecosystem, individuals are able to effortlessly acquire new skills and smoothly transition between jobs to meet evolving and emerging career demands, ensuring a workforce that is both adaptable and responsive to the city's needs.

### Objectives - Features to be Realized
Engage citizenry by helping them understand their role in society: Develop an interface that will allow users to input their occupational information, such as their current job titles, certifications, and CVs. City officials will also have a dedicated interface to feed available jobs into the system. Utilizing the system that maps user skills (extracted from job titles, certifications, and CVs) to job requirements defined by city officials. This will provide users with a list of recommended jobs based on their suitability improving the workforce industry.
Visualize key metrics to help smart city managers judge human capital requirements: Measurability is an important part of agile processes. In agile software development, teams utilize story points to infer whether or not their project is moving in the right direction. To effectively guide human capital reallocation, smart city managers must also have access to such metrics. By combining publicly available occupational statistics and input from the managers themselves, this system will predict future human capital requirements and use them to guide the citizenry towards filling potential gaps.
Encourage reskilling and upskilling: Once a user has expressed their interest in changing their occupation, the system recommends learning resources such as courses and certifications that would be well suited for their new goal.

### Scope
This system will target technical career fields surrounding a single city-wide area, and include all individuals who operate or will operate within the city's workforce ecosystem.

### Limitations
Given the proposed system’s reliance on existing job data sets to function, the proposed system's effectiveness is inherently limited to professions with well-represented data. Consequently, the project’s initial focus will be on a subset of jobs with robust data sets.
