# A System for Citizen-centric Human Resource Management in Smart Cities

## Overview 
In today’s rapidly changing world, traditional bureaucratic governance processes are often inadequate for handling human capital in modern societies. Smart cities, however, have the potential to revolutionize this dynamic by eschewing top-down command structures and instead utilizing agile governance principles to engage their citizenry directly in human resource management. This document proposes a system that will encourage collaboration between smart city managers and their populace to explore and enhance competencies available in the city’s workforce. The system aims to utilize users’ occupational information along with current job openings to guide users toward the best career path for them as individuals and the city as a whole. By combining labor statistics and input from smart city managers, this system would also predict future demand for city projects and encourage citizens to upskill or reskill to aid in them.

## Problem Statement - Background
In today's fast-paced world shaped by technological progress, the value of human skills is increasingly crucial for navigating these shifts. In city management, individual education plays a role at the micro (individual skills) and macro (human resource availability) levels. Traditional city management approaches, however, often have a significant lead time before they can embrace a new technology (Arendt, 2015). Though these methods contribute to positive outcomes of advancements, they focus on the top-down approach, giving most of the decision power to companies and cities themselves on how goals will be achieved. To combat this, by allowing citizens to steer their career paths, agile practitioners can introduce more flexible governance techniques that allow the city to “respond to public changes efficiently” (Mergel, 2020).

## Vision - Goals

This system aims to empower cities to leverage agile principles in utilizing human capital to foster a thriving, dynamic workforce ecosystem. In this ecosystem, individuals are empowered to acquire new skills and smoothly transition between jobs to meet evolving and emerging career demands, ensuring a workforce that is both adaptable and responsive to the city's needs.

## Objectives - Features to be Realized

Engage citizenry by allowing them to explore available opportunities
: Develop an interface that will allow citizens to explore their current capabilities. By sharing their current job title, certifications, and CVs, the system will attempt to categorize them into an occupation (using a standard classification system, such as US SOC codes). Once the user has confirmed that it is correct, it will then display opportunities relating to their current job. With user consent, this cleanly labeled data can be fed back into the system to train its models.

Provide a data-driven approach to human resource management in smart cities
: Measurability is an important part of agile processes. In agile software development, teams assign points to individual tasks and use historic data to determine their future workload capabilities. To effectively guide human capital reallocation, smart city managers must also have access to such metrics. By combining publicly available occupational statistics and input from the managers themselves, this system will predict future human capital requirements and use them to guide the citizenry towards filling potential gaps.

Encourage reskilling and upskilling by gamifying the process
: When a gap in the city's workforce is identified, the system will select individuals that possess skills related to the newly needed capabilities and offer them the option to exploring reskilling. Once a user has expressed interest in changing their occupation, the system will provide a roadmap that they can follow to reach their new goal. As users complete educational material or certifications recommended by the system, their progress will be tracked and can be viewed at any time. For particularly in-demand skills, smart city managers will have the option to place bounties on educational content that they want to drive more engagement towards.

## Scope and Limitations

* A single metropolitan area will be covered for the prototype.
* A limited subset of occupational segments will be covered based on available data for the prototype.

## Sustainability

The initial version of this system will be built with limited data. As citizens begin utilizing it and consent to sharing their data for training purposes, the system can be further refined with their labeled job titles, descriptions, and CVs.

## Security and Data Privacy

The system will follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that users do not have access to private data of their fellow citizens. Individuals will have access to only their own personal data, while smart city planners will only have access to anonymized details about individual citizens unless further access is consented to.

Additionally, the system will follow relevant regulations relating to user consent revocation. On request, citizens will be able to have their personal data purged from the system.
